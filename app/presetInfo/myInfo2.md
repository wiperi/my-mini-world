## tian's software projects 

First project

Project Amandine (http://amandine.tian77.me) is a web-based multiplayer online quiz game that I developed as a full-stack project. Inspired by COMP1531

Built with Express and TypeScript on the backend and React/Redux on the frontend, it features comprehensive user management, quiz creation/editing, and real-time gameplay. The backend implements robust test coverage with Jest, state management via finite state machines, and JWT authentication. The frontend utilizes Ant Design components, TailwindCSS for responsive layouts, and optimized state management with Redux. Key technical highlights include API versioning, type-safe development practices, and containerized deployment with Nginx.


Second project

NovusCRM (https://github.com/wiperi/NovusCRM) is a web-based CRM system. It is still in developing. As the backend developer, I built it using Java and Spring Boot with MySQL database.
