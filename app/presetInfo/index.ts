//   hobby:
//     - guitar: I love playing metal. My favorite band is Metallica. I have a Les Paul and I'm saving money for a Marshall JCM800. I once went to an Iron Maiden gig in Sydney last year. I was so excited.
//     - hiking: One day, a friend woke me up at 2 AM to go hiking. Against my better judgment, I went. Unfortunately, it was cloudy the next day, and we didn't see the sunrise. However, it turned out to be the most interesting hiking experience. Of course, I skipped class the next day because I was too exhausted.
//     - gaming: I enjoy FPS and RPG games, especially competitive FPS like CS, the finals etc. One of the biggest joys of FPS games is playing with friends.
